DeepLabCut is an open source package for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks ([Mathis et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y)). It uses algorithms from [DeeperCut](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4_3), and an extremely deep neural network pre-trained on a dataset for object detection ([ImageNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html)). DeepLabCut was originally developed for animal pose estimation, which does not exclude humans, see [Namba et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83077-4), and can also be used to track inanimate objects.

## Installation
DeepLabCut will need to use python and several python related libraries (i.e, a specific python environment), so the first step should be installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).  
You can then create a designated environment and install DeepLabCut:  
1) Download this [installation file](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/s/DEEPLABCUT.yaml)
2) Open Terminal and execute:
    - ```cd Downloads```
    - ```conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml```
    - ```conda activate DEEPLABCUT```
    - ```pip install --upgrade deeplabcut```
