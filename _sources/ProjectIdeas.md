# Project Ideas

This is only a preliminary collection of project ideas to get you inspired. You are encouraged to work in groups and develop your own projects. These can, but don't necessarily need to be oriented on the datasets and ideas provided here.  

## Non-human animals

* Analysis of pigeon posture
* Analysis of mouse location and kinematics
* Synchronicity of fly locomotion

## Human animals

* Tracking emotional facial expressions
* Tracking hand movement and guitar chords

## Meta-projects

* Compare tracking performance with different labels
* Effects of video quality on tracking performance

# Group Projects

:::{tip} Your final project will be featured here at the end of the course!
