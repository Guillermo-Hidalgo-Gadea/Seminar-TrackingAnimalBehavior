## Course Handbook
**This is the course handbook for the block seminar Tracking Animal Behavior at the Ruhr-University Bochum for the Winter Semester 2021/22.**

In the following pages we will discuss what we mean by behavior and how we can measure it. We will learn to use [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) to track body parts from video data and analyze spatiotemporal dynamics to track animal behavior.

You can access this handbook online from [GuillermoHidalgoGadea.com]() or [GitHub](https://github.com/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/Seminar-TrackingAnimalBehavior), and download specific sections as pdf in the upper right corner:
